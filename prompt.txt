Design a booking website for a hair salon called Sheek Hair. 
Use python and flask to build the website. 
Use mysql lite for the database.
Use fullcalendar javascript library to implement a calendar with graphical create and drag drop events.
Days of the week are Monday to Sunday from 9am to 6pm.

The website should have the following features:
- admin has a login: {admin, admin123}, users can login: {user, user123}
- show a calendar view of available appointments
- allow users to book appointments on the calendar
- when booking appointments, user will prvide:
    - name, phone number and date and time, and select services needed: 
    { {men haircut, 30 mins}, {womens haircut, 1 hour}, {childrens haircut, 30 mins}
      {perm, 2 hour}, {magic, 2.5 hour} }
- when a user books an appointment, the calendar view should be updated to reflect the new booking
- all bookings are saved to the database, and marked as booked on calendar for everyone
- admin can view all bookings and phone numbers, can edit, delete and add new services
- users can view and edit their own bookings and can only see if a time slot is available


In all html pages, add a footer with information: "Sheek hair studio, 3457 Bethel Dr #F, West Lafayette, IN 47906, Phone: (765) 838-0117"
